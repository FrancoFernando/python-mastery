# Exercise 20: Word Count

## Description

 Write a word_count function that mimics the wc Unix command. The function will take a filename as input and will print four lines of output:

- Number of characters (including whitespace)
- Number of words (separated by whitespace)
- Number of lines
- Number of unique words (case sensitive, so “NO” is different from “no”)

## Learning

- set and dict have an update method that takes iterables
- putting stats in a dict helps to write cleaner code
