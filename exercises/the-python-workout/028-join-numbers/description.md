# Exercise 28: Join Numbers

## Description

Write a function, join_numbers, that takes a range of integers. The function should return those numbers as a string, with commas between the numbers. That is, given range(15) as input, the function should return this string:
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

## Learning

- If the point of your for loop is the creation of a new list, use a comprehension. But if your goal is to execute something once for each element in an iterable, throwing away or ignoring any return value, a for loop is preferable.
