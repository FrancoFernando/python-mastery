# Exercise 6: Pig Latin Sentence

## Description

Write a function called pl_sentence that takes a string containing several words, separated by spaces. If someone were to call
pl_sentence('this is a test translation')
the output would be
"histay isway away estay ranslationtay".
Print the output on a single line, rather than with each word on a separate line.
