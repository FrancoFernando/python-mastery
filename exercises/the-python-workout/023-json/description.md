# Exercise 23: Json

## Description

Write a function, print_scores, that takes a directory name as an argument and prints a summary of the student scores it finds. Each directory contains multiple files and each file contains the JSON equivalent of a list of dicts, with each dict containing scores for several different school subjects. Your function should print the highest, lowest, and average test scores for each subject in each class.
