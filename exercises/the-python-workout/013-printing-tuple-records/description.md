# Exercise 13: Printing Tuple Records

## Description

Assume we’re in charge of an upcoming G7 summit. We have information about each of the participating countries as a list of tuples. Write a Python function, format_sort_records, that takes the COUNTRIES list of tuples, and returns a formatted string that has each country appearing on its own line, with three nicely aligned columns. The countries should be presented in alphabetical order by country name.
