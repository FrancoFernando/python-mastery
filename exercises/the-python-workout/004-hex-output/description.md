# Write a hexadecimal output

- write a function (hex_output) that asks the user for a hex number and prints the decimal equivalent. 
- If the user enters 50, you’ll assume that it’s a hex number (equal to 0x50) and will print the value 80 to the screen.
- You shouldn’t convert the number all at once using the int function, although it’s permissible to use int one digit at a time.
