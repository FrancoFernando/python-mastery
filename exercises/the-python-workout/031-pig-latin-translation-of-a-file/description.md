# Exercise 31: Pig Latin Translation Of A File

## Description

Write a function plfile that takes a filename as an argument. It returns a string with the file’s contents, but with each word translated into Pig Latin, as per our plword function in chapter 3 on strings. The returned translation can ignore newlines and isn’t required to handle capitalization and punctuation in any specific way.
