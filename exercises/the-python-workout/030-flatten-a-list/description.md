# Exercise 30: Flatten A List

## Description

In this exercise, we’ll practice doing such unraveling. Write a function that takes a list of lists (just one element deep) and returns a flat, one-dimensional version of the list. Thus, invoking
flatten([[1,2], [3,4]]) will return [1,2,3,4]. There are several possible solutions to this problem. Solve it with list comprehensions. Also, we only need to worry about flattening a two-level list.
